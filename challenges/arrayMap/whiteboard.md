### Class 01 Code Challenge - arrayMap Whiteboard

This one seems pretty straightforward - spin through a for loop based on the length of the array. Within the loop, send each indexed item in the array off to the function passed in as an argument. Can't push since that's an Array method, but can we simply += add it to the new array? Or assign it at the current index?
